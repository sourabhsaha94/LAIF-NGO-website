We at LAIF are a group of lawyers willing to provide pro bono legal services to the people who cannot afford legal representation.
The State Legal Services are overburdened with cases and underrepresented by lawyers. The lack of decent representation to the litigants at Courts has made us come together for a common cause.
The panel consists of established lawyers and law firms, having expertise not just limited to criminal and civil litigation but also various other aspects of law. Our lawyers have first-hand experience in pro bono litigation.
We have collaborated with the Legal Aid Cell of Symbiosis Law School, Noida which will be assisting us with dedicated students committed for the cause of legal aid for carrying out further activities. We are expanding and welcome more people to join us.
