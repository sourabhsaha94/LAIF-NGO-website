The kind of world we live in is not very ideal. We have more problems than solutions, more cases than lawyers, with more cases arising every day.
We are marred with different problems every day; be it problems of safety, sanitation, education or anything for that matter. While we cannot eradicate every single problem, we can ensure speedy and fair justice to the people who cannot afford it.
Every person has a role to play in society and this is our bit towards the same. Legal aid is the provision of assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal representation and access to the court system.
We at LAIF, have come together for a common cause to help the society in providing pro bono legal representation to the people who cannot afford it, as we strongly believe that no one should be deprived of the right to be heard simply because he cannot pay for it.
We strive to represent more people and help them with legal aid as our contribution towards society and its people.
